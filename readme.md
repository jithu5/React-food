## Acknowledgements
This project was created with the help of a React course on Udemy. The course provided valuable insights into building dynamic and responsive web applications using React.

Special thanks to the instructor **Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller** and the course content for guiding the development of this food app.

During this project, I also learned a lot about debugging and solving issues independently. It was a rewarding experience to troubleshoot problems, understand the underlying concepts, and implement additional features to enhance the app's functionality.
